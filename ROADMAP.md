# MOSDAC AI Help Bot - Essential Tasks Roadmap

## Core Components (MVP)

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline (High Priority)
- [x] Basic entity extraction (satellites, instruments, parameters)
- [x] Implement document chunking and cleaning
- [x] Set up basic text preprocessing (stopwords, lemmatization)
- [x] Create document loader for MOSDAC content

### 2. Knowledge Graph (High Priority)
- [x] Basic graph structure with NetworkX
- [x] Entity and relationship models
- [x] Implement graph persistence (save/load)
- [x] Add basic graph querying capabilities

### 3. Retrieval Pipeline (High Priority)
- [x] Implement basic TF-IDF retriever
- [x] Set up vector store (ChromaDB)
- [x] Create hybrid retriever (combine keyword and vector search)
- [x] Add basic relevance ranking

### 4. Query Processing (High Priority)
- [x] Enhanced query processor with domain-specific knowledge
- [x] Advanced intent classification (15+ MOSDAC-specific intents)
- [x] Entity extraction with support for technical terms
- [x] Query expansion using synonyms and acronyms
- [x] Temporal and spatial information extraction
- [ ] Response generation templates

### 5. API Layer (Medium Priority)
- [ ] FastAPI setup
- [ ] Basic search endpoint
- [ ] Response formatting
- [ ] Error handling

## Testing & Validation (Critical)
- [x] Unit tests for core components (Knowledge Graph, Text Processing)
- [ ] Integration tests for retrieval pipeline
- [ ] Basic test cases for common queries
- [ ] Performance testing with sample queries

## Deployment (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Containerization (Docker)
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Logging configuration

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
1. Advanced NLP features (NER, coreference resolution)
2. Improved relationship extraction
3. Query understanding with LLMs
4. User feedback mechanism
5. Advanced analytics dashboard

## Quick Wins (For Demo)
1. Pre-populate with sample MOSDAC data
2. Implement 5-10 key query templates
3. Basic frontend for demo purposes
4. Simple caching mechanism for frequent queries

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Integration & API (High Priority)
- [ ] Integrate enhanced query processor with RAG pipeline
- [ ] Set up FastAPI endpoints for search
- [ ] Implement response formatting and serialization
- [ ] Add request/response validation

### 2. Advanced Query Processing (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement query rewriting based on intent
- [ ] Add support for complex queries (AND/OR, filters, ranges)
- [ ] Implement query understanding with context awareness
- [ ] Add support for follow-up questions

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add caching for frequent queries
- [ ] Implement result caching
- [ ] Optimize vector search performance
- [ ] Add support for batch processing

### 4. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement result diversification
- [ ] Add support for faceted search
- [ ] Implement query autocomplete
- [ ] Add spell checking and query correction

### 5. Testing & Evaluation
- [ ] Create benchmark dataset
- [ ] Implement evaluation metrics (precision@k, recall@k, NDCG)
- [ ] Set up automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Notes
- Focus on end-to-end flow first, then optimize
- Use simple but effective approaches for MVP
- Document all components and APIs
- Keep the code modular for future enhancements
